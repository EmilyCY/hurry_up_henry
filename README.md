Project Description

The future of the economy and work is digital whereas the increasing relevance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to new challenges for young Australians to develop new forms of digital literacy skills. However, these are unpredictable, so a lack of digital literacy leads to devastating social and economic outcomes for individuals and for Australia. This timely project seeks to assess students’ performance on digital literacy that leads to student’s choice of degree and future career. 

ICT education deals with matters involving digital technologies and digital literacy for young learners from primary to university education. There is a lack of attention to digital literacy enhancement in traditional and new pedagogical environments around the schools in Australia. This leads to poorer outcomes towards one’s professional choices and this is a critical issue for Australia’s economic, social, and educational growth compared to other countries.

Project Objective

This project is focused on the development of a mobile learning application for Kindergarten. The application is implemented in android- based mobile devices. It should provides a digital content of information, a user-friendly environment to kindergarteners that enables them to be more productive and engaged in learing activities, and one-size-fits-all learning. 

The objective of the study is to determine and analyse the following: 

1. Identify the kindergarten teaching strategies and the challenges of learning
2. Determine the development tools and platform for the mobile learning application.
3. Design and develop the mobile application appropriate for the kindergarten kids to learn
    (1) Recognise letters and numbers 
    (2) Use the application to be an instructor for initiating questions while kids work with letter cards on the floor
    (3) Design game-based learning such as fun Quiz, puzzles, picture-based, pretend play games.
